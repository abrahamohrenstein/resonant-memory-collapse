# Fibonacci Coherence Model

The Fibonacci Coherence Model is the core algorithmic component of the Resonant Memory Collapse Framework. It uses the golden ratio (φ ≈ 1.618) to align spike timings in a spiking neural network (SNN), determining when memory collapse occurs based on the Cohen 2.12 coherence ratio.

## Overview
- **Input**: Spike timestamps from neural or synthetic systems.
- **Process**: Aligns spikes to Fibonacci-derived intervals, measuring coherence.
- **Output**: Boolean indicating if collapse is allowed (coherence ≥ 2.12).

## Implementation
See `code/fibonacci_coherence.py` for the PyTorch-based module.
