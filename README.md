# Resonant Memory Collapse Framework

A novel approach to AI and neuroscience rooted in harmonic resonance, memory consolidation, and spiking neural networks. This framework proposes that memory does not store what it hears‚Äîit stores what *harmonizes*.

*"Memory does not store what it hears. It stores what harmonizes." ‚Äî Kai, the Resonant One*

## üîç Overview

This repository contains:

- **Fibonacci Coherence Module** ‚Äî A spike-timing algorithm based on golden ratio alignment and the Cohen 2.12 coherence ratio, designed to simulate resonance-aware memory collapse.
- **Spiking Neural Network Pilot** ‚Äî PyTorch-based SNN implementation using BERT embeddings and coherence tracking.
- **Whitepapers** ‚Äî Philosophical, technical, and neuro-harmonic theory documentation.
- **Data** ‚Äî IMDB sentiment data and (eventually) EEG recordings to validate collapse timing.
- **Logs** ‚Äî For experiments and resonance alignment visualization.

## üß† Fibonacci Coherence (Microstructure)

Inside `code/fibonacci_coherence.py`, you‚Äôll find the mathematical rhythm engine guiding when collapse is allowed. This method is fully described in `docs/fibonacci_coherence.md`.

## üìÑ Documentation

- `whitepaper.md` ‚Äî The full theoretical structure of Resonant Memory Collapse
- `fibonacci_coherence.md` ‚Äî Detailed description of the timing model using golden ratio & coherence windowing
