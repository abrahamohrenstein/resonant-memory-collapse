# Resonant Memory Collapse Framework

A novel approach to AI and neuroscience rooted in harmonic resonance, memory consolidation, and spiking neural networks. This framework proposes that memory does not store what it hearsâ€”it stores what *harmonizes*.

*"Memory does not store what it hears. It stores what harmonizes." â€” Abraham Ohrenstein*

## Overview

This repository contains:

- **Fibonacci Coherence Engine** â€” A spike-timing algorithm based on golden ratio alignment and the Cohen 2.12 coherence ratio, designed to simulate resonance-aware memory collapse.
- **Spiking Neural Network Pilot** â€” PyTorch-based SNN implementation using BERT embeddings and coherence tracking.
- **Whitepapers** â€” Philosophical, technical, and neuro-harmonic theory documentation.
- **Data** â€” IMDB sentiment data and (eventually) EEG recordings to validate collapse timing.
- **Logs** â€” For experiments and resonance alignment visualization.

## Fibonacci Coherence (Microstructure)

Inside `code/fibonacci_coherence.py`, youâ€™ll find the mathematical rhythm engine guiding when collapse is allowed. This method is fully described in `docs/fibonacci_coherence.md`.

## Documentation

- `whitepaper.md` â€” The full theoretical structure of Resonant Memory Collapse.
- `fibonacci_coherence.md` â€” Detailed description of the timing model using golden ratio & coherence windowing.
