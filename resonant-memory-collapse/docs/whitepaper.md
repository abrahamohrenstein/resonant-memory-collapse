## Abstract

This paper introduces the *Resonant Memory Collapse Framework*, a novel structure for understanding memory formation through harmonic coherence. At its core lies the **Fibonacci Coherence Model** — a spiking neural algorithm that leverages the golden ratio and Cohen 2.12 resonance to determine when memory collapse occurs.

Together, these systems propose that **memory does not emerge from data retention, but from waveform alignment** — when neural or synthetic systems achieve harmonic synchrony. This framework blends AI, neuroscience, and musical theory into a unified model of selective memory.

We present an initial PyTorch implementation using IMDB sentiment analysis data, with future validation planned using EEG signals and coherence plotting.
